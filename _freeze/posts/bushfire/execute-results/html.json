How much did anthropogenic climate change increase the likelihood of the risk factors that drove that season—extreme heat, drought, and fire weather? And what does that imply for future seasons?\n\n*(This post adapts results from van Oldenborgh et al., 2021 and supporting sources.)*\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Data & sources\n\n- Attribution study: van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), *NHESS* — observational records, reanalyses, and multiple model ensembles to estimate probability ratios (PR) for extremes under today’s vs pre-industrial climate [@oldenborgh2021].  \n- Context: IPCC AR6 WGI (2021) [@ipcc2021] and CSIRO/BOM State of the Climate (2020) [@csiro2020].\n\n### Findings (heat, drought, fire weather)\n\n- Extreme heat: events like Dec-2019 are ≥2× as likely due to warming; long records suggest up to ~10× increase.  \n- Drought: attribution inconclusive for 2019—the IOD and SAM dominated that year’s rainfall deficits.  \n- Fire weather (FWI / MSR): extremes are roughly 4–9× more likely now than in early 20th century; models tend to underestimate the observed increase.\n\nTo visualize these reported ranges, we encode a simple dataset (min/central/max PR) and draw a range plot. The figure is a communication aid (not a new estimate).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(\n  factor = c(\"Extreme heat\", \"Fire weather (FWI/MSR)\", \"Drought\"),\n  pr_min = c(2, 4, 0.8),     # drought 'around 1' ~ inconclusive; show ~0.8–1.2 band\n  pr_cen = c(5, 6.5, 1.0),   # simple central communication values\n  pr_max = c(10, 9, 1.2)\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = pr_cen, y = factor)) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = pr_min, xmax = pr_max), linewidth = 2, alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"Probability ratio (today vs pre-industrial)\", y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Reported ranges of probability ratios (PR) that climate change increased the likelihood of risk factors during the Black Summer.

A multi-model approach reduces dependence on any single model. Notably, @oldenborgh2021 report that models likely understate the observed rise in fire weather, so real-world risk may be higher than central model estimates.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClimate change materially increased the likelihood of the heat and fire-weather extremes that drove Black Summer, while drought attribution for 2019 remained inconclusive due to strong natural modes (IOD/SAM). This aligns with @oldenborgh2021 and the broader assessments in @ipcc2021 and @csiro2020.\n\nSo we expect more frequent severe fire seasons under further warming; treat modelled fire-weather increases as possibly conservative (models understate observed trends). Priorities: infrastructure hardening, emergency capacity, land-use planning—and mitigation to limit future risk.\n\n## References\n\nvan Oldenborgh, G. J., Krikken, F., Lewis, S., Leach, N.
