I’m a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University. Previously, have worked as a business development professional who turns data, customer insight, and disciplined execution into growth. I’ve led sales teams, built repeatable go-to-market playbooks, and improved retention through tighter customer relationships and smarter use of analytics.

Right now I’m focused on sharpening my Business Analytics & Data Science toolkit so I can take strategy from slideware to measurable outcomes: cleaner pipelines, faster feedback loops, and dashboards that leaders actually use. I enjoy translating messy signals (CRM, ops, finance) into simple decisions the team can rally behind.

Previously I led a 15-person sales team with a strong culture of self-drive and accountability, built planning cadences that lifted revenue and share, and deepened key-account relationships through upsell and service add-ons. Before that, I ran day-to-day operations—shipping/receiving, inventory control, and transport—tracking KPIs, fixing bottlenecks with cross-functional partners, and coaching teams to higher productivity.

I’m most at home where customers, numbers, and narrative meet: give me a target, a dataset and I’ll ship something I'm proud of on time.

Skills & interests: sales strategy, account growth, CRM optimisation, business intelligence, team coaching, data storytelling with R/Quarto/GitHub.

Education: B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering), UIET—MD University, India.
