Previously, have worked as a business development professional who turns data, customer insight, and disciplined execution into growth. I’ve led sales teams, built repeatable go-to-market playbooks, and improved retention through tighter customer relationships and smarter use of analytics.\nRight now I’m focused on sharpening my Business Analytics & Data Science toolkit so I can take strategy from slideware to measurable outcomes: cleaner pipelines, faster feedback loops, and dashboards that leaders actually use. I enjoy translating messy signals (CRM, ops, finance) into simple decisions the team can rally behind.\nPreviously I led a 15-person sales team with a strong culture of self-drive and accountability, built planning cadences that lifted revenue and share, and deepened key-account relationships through upsell and service add-ons. Before that, I ran day-to-day operations—shipping/receiving, inventory control, and transport—tracking KPIs, fixing bottlenecks with cross-functional partners, and coaching teams to higher productivity.\nI’m most at home where customers, numbers, and narrative meet: give me a target, a dataset and I’ll ship something I’m proud of on time.\nSkills & interests: sales strategy, account growth, CRM optimisation, business intelligence, team coaching, data storytelling with R/Quarto/GitHub.\nEducation: B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering), UIET—MD University, India."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nData & sources\n\nAttribution study: van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), NHESS — observational records, reanalyses, and multiple model ensembles to estimate probability ratios (PR) for extremes under today’s vs pre-industrial climate [@oldenborgh2021].\n\nContext: IPCC AR6 WGI (2021) [@ipcc2021] and CSIRO/BOM State of the Climate (2020) [@csiro2020].\n\n\n\nFindings (heat, drought, fire weather)\n\nExtreme heat: events like Dec-2019 are ≥2× as likely due to warming; long records suggest up to ~10× increase.\n\nDrought: attribution inconclusive for 2019—the IOD and SAM dominated that year’s rainfall deficits.\n\nFire weather (FWI / MSR): extremes are roughly 4–9× more likely now than in early 20th century; models tend to underestimate the observed increase.\n\nTo visualize these reported ranges, we encode a simple dataset (min/central/max PR) and draw a range plot. The figure is a communication aid (not a new estimate).\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  factor = c(\"Extreme heat\", \"Fire weather (FWI/MSR)\", \"Drought\"),\n  pr_min = c(2, 4, 0.8),     # drought 'around 1' ~ inconclusive; show ~0.8–1.2 band\n  pr_cen = c(5, 6.5, 1.0),   # simple central communication values\n  pr_max = c(10, 9, 1.2)\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = pr_cen, y = factor)) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = pr_min, xmax = pr_max), linewidth = 2, alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"Probability ratio (today vs pre-industrial)\", y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Reported ranges of probability ratios (PR) that climate change increased the likelihood of risk factors during the Black Summer. Bars show min–max; point marks a central communication value. Adapted from @oldenborgh2021, with context from @ipcc2021 and @csiro2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, heat and fire weather push well above PR = 1 (more likely now), while drought hovers near ~1 (no robust detection for 2019).\n\n\nModels used in the attribution study\nThe original study uses several large ensembles across CMIP generations and attribution projects. Table 1 lists a small subset to show the diversity of models\n\n\n\nTable 1: Subset of climate model ensembles referenced in van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), illustrating diversity across projects and ensemble sizes.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\nensembles &lt;- tribble(\n  ~Model,           ~Project,      ~Resolution, ~Members, ~Period,\n  \"CanESM2\",        \"CMIP5\",       \"2.8°\",      50,       \"1950–2099\",\n  \"CESM1-CAM5\",     \"CMIP5\",       \"1.0°\",      40,       \"1920–2100\",\n  \"EC-Earth\",       \"CMIP5\",       \"1.1°\",      16,       \"1860–2100\",\n  \"HadGEM3-A\",      \"Attribution\", \"0.6°\",      15,       \"1960–2015\",\n  \"IPSL-CM6A-LR\",   \"CMIP6\",       \"2.5×1.5°\",  32,       \"1950–2019\",\n  \"MPI-ESM\",        \"CMIP5\",       \"1.9°\",      100,      \"1850–2099\",\n  \"weather@home\",   \"Attribution\", \"≈1.8°\",     1520,     \"1987–2017\"\n)\n\nensembles\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 5\n  Model        Project     Resolution Members Period   \n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 CanESM2      CMIP5       2.8°            50 1950–2099\n2 CESM1-CAM5   CMIP5       1.0°            40 1920–2100\n3 EC-Earth     CMIP5       1.1°            16 1860–2100\n4 HadGEM3-A    Attribution 0.6°            15 1960–2015\n5 IPSL-CM6A-LR CMIP6       2.5×1.5°        32 1950–2019\n6 MPI-ESM      CMIP5       1.9°           100 1850–2099\n7 weather@home Attribution ≈1.8°         1520 1987–2017\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters. A multi-model approach reduces dependence on any single model. Notably, @oldenborgh2021 report that models likely understate the observed rise in fire weather, so real-world risk may be higher than central model estimates."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nClimate change materially increased the likelihood of the heat and fire-weather extremes that drove Black Summer, while drought attribution for 2019 remained inconclusive due to strong natural modes (IOD/SAM). This aligns with @oldenborgh2021 and the broader assessments in @ipcc2021 and @csiro2020.\nSo we expect more frequent severe fire seasons under further warming; treat modelled fire-weather increases as possibly conservative (models understate observed trends). Priorities: infrastructure hardening, emergency capacity, land-use planning—and mitigation to limit future risk."
