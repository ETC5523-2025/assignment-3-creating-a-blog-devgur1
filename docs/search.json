    "text": "I’m a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University. Previously, have worked as a business development professional who turns data, customer insight, and disciplined execution into growth. I’ve led sales teams, built repeatable go-to-market playbooks, and improved retention through tighter customer relationships and smarter use of analytics.\nRight now I’m focused on sharpening my Business Analytics & Data Science toolkit so I can take strategy from slideware to measurable outcomes: cleaner pipelines, faster feedback loops, and dashboards that leaders actually use. I enjoy translating messy signals (CRM, ops, finance) into simple decisions the team can rally behind.\nPreviously I led a 15-person sales team with a strong culture of self-drive and accountability, built planning cadences that lifted revenue and share, and deepened key-account relationships through upsell and service add-ons. Before that, I ran day-to-day operations—shipping/receiving, inventory control, and transport—tracking KPIs, fixing bottlenecks with cross-functional partners, and coaching teams to higher productivity.\nI’m most at home where customers, numbers, and narrative meet: give me a target, a dataset and I’ll ship something I’m proud of on time.\nSkills & interests: sales strategy, account growth, CRM optimisation, business intelligence, team coaching, data storytelling with R/Quarto/GitHub.\nEducation: B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering), UIET—MD University, India."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nData & sources\n\nAttribution study: van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), NHESS — observational records, reanalyses, and multiple model ensembles to estimate probability ratios (PR) for extremes under today’s vs pre-industrial climate [@oldenborgh2021].\n\nContext: IPCC AR6 WGI (2021) [@ipcc2021] and CSIRO/BOM State of the Climate (2020) [@csiro2020].\n\n\n\nFindings (heat, drought, fire weather)\n\nExtreme heat: events like Dec-2019 are ≥2× as likely due to warming; long records suggest up to ~10× increase.\n\nDrought: attribution inconclusive for 2019—the IOD and SAM dominated that year’s rainfall deficits.\n\nFire weather (FWI / MSR): extremes are roughly 4–9× more likely now than in early 20th century; models tend to underestimate the observed increase.\n\nTo visualize these reported ranges, we encode a simple dataset (min/central/max PR) and draw a range plot. The figure is a communication aid (not a new estimate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Probability ratios (PR) for Black Summer drivers with uncertainty. The light band marks ‘no clear change’ around PR≈1; values to the right indicate higher likelihood in today’s climate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, heat and fire weather push well above PR = 1 (more likely now), while drought hovers near ~1 (no robust detection for 2019).\n\n\nModels used in the attribution study\nThe original study uses several large ensembles across CMIP generations and attribution projects. Table 1 lists a small subset to show the diversity of models\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Subset of climate model ensembles referenced in van Oldenborgh et al. (2021), illustrating diversity across projects and ensemble sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nProject\nResolution\nMembers\nPeriod\n\n\n\n\nCanESM2\nCMIP5\n2.8°\n50\n1950–2099\n\n\nCESM1-CAM5\nCMIP5\n1.0°\n40\n1920–2100\n\n\nEC-Earth\nCMIP5\n1.1°\n16\n1860–2100\n\n\nHadGEM3-A\nAttribution\n0.6°\n15\n1960–2015\n\n\nIPSL-CM6A-LR\nCMIP6\n2.5×1.5°\n32\n1950–2019\n\n\nMPI-ESM\nCMIP5\n1.9°\n100\n1850–2099\n\n\nweather@home\nAttribution\n≈1.8°\n1,520\n1987–2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters. A multi-model approach reduces dependence on any single model. Notably, @oldenborgh2021 report that models likely understate the observed rise in fire weather, so real-world risk may be higher than central model estimates."

    "text": "Conclusion\nClimate change materially increased the likelihood of the heat and fire-weather extremes that drove Black Summer, while drought attribution for 2019 remained inconclusive due to strong natural modes (IOD/SAM). This aligns with @oldenborgh2021 and the broader assessments in @ipcc2021 and @csiro2020.\nSo we expect more frequent severe fire seasons under further warming; treat modelled fire-weather increases as possibly conservative (models understate observed trends). Priorities: infrastructure hardening, emergency capacity, land-use planning—and mitigation to limit future risk.\nFor planners and emergency services, treat modelled fire-weather increases as conservative, and prioritise infrastructure hardening, response capacity, land-use planning, and emissions mitigation."
